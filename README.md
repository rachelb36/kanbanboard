# Kanban Board
# Challenge 5 - Third-Party APIs Challenge: Task Board

## Descriptionas

- Digital Task Board
- An "Add Task" button is at the top of the page to allow user to add a new task card.
- When task cards are created, they have a yellow background if due that day.  If past due, the card will have a red background.  If the card is dragged to the "done" column the card becomes white, if previously had a red or yellow background.
- When page is fired up any tasks that are saved in localStorage are placed on the board in the status column it was previously in the last time the web page was opened - "todo", "in-progress" or "done".
- A user can individual drag task cards across status columns or delete a task.
- When a task card has a status change or is deleted, the localStorage is updated.

### Tasks completed
- Using provided starter code, completed script.js page using JQuery, wherever possible.
- Added a hidden modal to HTML page that is hidden until user clicks "Add Task" button.
- Added BootStrap styles for styling Query pop up that displays a monthly calendar so user can pick due date easily.
- Implemented JQuery UI "draggable" capability to task cards and made status columns "droppable".
